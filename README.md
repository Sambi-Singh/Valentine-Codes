# Valentine-Codes
A short, but fun exercise using basic html and css to make a valentines gift for my lady I love. Based off elementary school Valentines Cipher games. Where students were given a set of codes and had to decipher a message from the codes. The codes ranging  from visuals such as hearts, flowers, etc.
