    <h1>Happy Valentines Day!</h1>
   
    <div class="valentineCard">
      <h2>To Gaby,</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you so much for being the wonderful and frankly adorable person
        you are. I am so incredibly blessed to have you in my life. You seriously
        motivate me to be better! My admiration for your work ethic knows no bounds.
        Moreover, you make me feel seen and listened to like no one else. You're also
        really pretty too (though I think you know this)!<br />
      </p>

      <p>
            I love how much of a go-getter you are, especially when it comes to work,
        school, and your family. Also, I enjoy seeing you smile at my dumb jokes/comments!
        It really makes my day :D
        But, sometimes you worry me with how hard you work (and the amount of
        caffeine you consume)... :( so please remember to take a break now and then
        whenever possible. It honestly breaks my heart seeing you all worn out from
        the drudges of daily life...</p>

        <p>
       I want to say more, but I will do so in person at a later time. Just know
        I will always be here for you, supporting you, speaking to you, spending time
        with you, and always throwing a crap ton of my affection your way!!! I plan to
        do all these things for the foreseeable future anyway :)</p>
    
      <p>Warmly,</p>
      <p>Sambi</p>

      <p>PS: Heres a sticker of a minecraft doggie and my favorite pokemon piplup!</p>
